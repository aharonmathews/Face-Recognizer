# Face-Recognizer

Face Recognizer using Haar Cascade Classifier for the project
Feeds data constantly to the model and their adaptability in real-time sets Haar classifiers apart in dynamic object detection.

Though it is purely made to recognize only faces and seem like a traditional Classifier of ED

### Use Cases:
Real-time Face-Recognizer find applications in various fields, such as:

*Security and Surveillance*: Haar classifiers can continuously update their dataset to improve their ability to detect and track objects of interest in surveillance cameras.

*Autonomous Vehicles*: In self-driving cars, Haar classifiers can adapt to changing road conditions and identify objects on the go, ensuring safe navigation.

*Facial Recognition*: For biometric applications, Haar classifiers can learn from different lighting conditions, angles, and facial expressions to enhance accuracy.

*Quality Control*: In manufacturing, these classifiers can be used to detect defects or anomalies in real-time, helping maintain product quality.
